            <p>
                I'm from Bellingham and I'm a junior student at WWU, where I'm really enjoying my college experience so far. I really like doing 3D art and sound design as well - I find these creative outlets give me a way to express myself digitally. I've been exploring different software and techniques to improve my skills in both areas.
                Doing YouTube and making videos/projects with friends is one of my favorite things to do. We collaborate on everything from short films to music videos, and the creative process is always exciting. The satisfaction of seeing a finished project after all our hard work is incredibly rewarding.
                Going to garage sales and trying to find a deal is also goated. There's something thrilling about hunting for hidden treasures and negotiating prices. I've found some amazing pieces for my collection this way.
                I'm always trying to make something or learn a new tool. This constant curiosity keeps me engaged and growing as a creator.
